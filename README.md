## Technical Design

### Code Structure

The **Arduino Lab** project is organized following Django's standard MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure, allowing for a clear separation of responsibilities. This structure helps with scalability, maintainability, and collaboration across different parts of the project.

#### Code Structure

The codebase for **Arduino Lab** is divided into modular Django apps, following Djangoâ€™s best practices to separate functionality across the different areas of the project.

- **Home** - Provides the basic functionality for the homepage, displaying the welcome message, featured products, and navigation options.
  
- **Products** - Manages all functionality related to the products, including listing, filtering by category, and product details. This app supports various microcontrollers like ESP, STM, AVR, ARM, and Raspberry Pi.

- **Cart** - Implements shopping cart functionality, allowing users to add products, update quantities, and view their cart before proceeding to checkout.

- **Checkout** - Handles the checkout process, including order summary, payment processing, and order confirmation.

- **Profiles** - Manages user profiles, order history, and personal details for logged-in users. This feature is branded as "My Arduino Lab."

- **User Account** - Allows users to manage their accounts, including account deletion and authentication functionalities provided by Django allauth.

**Other Directories and Files**

- **static/** - Contains CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets used across the project.
  
- **media/** - Stores images for the development environment. In production, images are hosted separately on a cloud storage provider.

- **arduino_lab/** - Main Django project folder containing project settings, URLs, and configuration files for the entire project.

- **templates/** - Contains the base HTML templates, as well as templates specifically designed for Django allauth authentication (login, signup, etc.).

- **manage.py** - The primary Django command-line utility for executing administrative tasks, such as running the server, database migrations, and other commands.

- **README.md** - This file provides documentation for the project, including setup instructions, features, and usage information.

- **custom_storages.py** - Manages storage configurations for media and static files on a cloud provider, such as AWS S3, in the production environment.

- **Procfile** - Defines commands for deploying the app to Heroku, specifying how to start the web server.

- **requirements.txt** - Lists all dependencies and libraries required for the project, allowing for easy installation with `pip`.

- **robots.txt** and **sitemap.xml** - Configured for search engine optimization to help search engines index the site efficiently.

Environment variables such as API keys and database credentials are securely managed in the backend for both the development environment and the Heroku App settings. This ensures that sensitive information is protected and only accessible by authorized systems.


### Database

This project uses a PostgreSQL database hosted by Code Institute, designed to support full-featured e-commerce functionality. The database configuration provided by Code Institute simplifies the setup, allowing me to focus on developing and implementing features rather than database infrastructure.

##  Scope - Epics and User Stories 
  ### Agile Workflow

To organize and manage the development process of the **Arduino Lab** project, I created two Agile boards, each representing a set of user stories that focus on distinct aspects of the project. This method enabled an efficient workflow, allowing me to structure the project setup and feature implementation in a systematic and visual manner.

#### Project Setup Board

The first board is dedicated to the setup phase of the project, covering foundational configurations and initial setup tasks. This board is a collection of tasks that establish the project environment, necessary installations, and settings, forming the groundwork for further development.

**Completed Tasks:**

- #### Epic 1:  Django Project Initialization:
  As a developer, I want to initialize a new Django project so that I can build the e-commerce platform.

- #### Epic 2: Install Required Packages:
  As a developer, I want to install essential packages like Django REST framework, Pillow, and PostgreSQL support so that I can develop key features of the e-commerce site.
- #### Epic 3: Setup Admin Panel for Store Management:
  As a developer, I want to configure the Django admin panel to manage products, categories, and orders so that the store owner can manage the shop from the backend.
- #### Epic 4: User Authentication Setup:
  As a developer, I want to set up user authentication (registration, login, logout) so that customers can create and manage accounts on the site.
- #### Epic 5: E-commerce App Creation:
  As a developer, I want to create a Django app for handling the storeâ€™s products, categories, and orders so that the e-commerce functionalities are organized.
- #### Epic 6: Database Configuration:
  As a developer, I want to configure a PostgreSQL database for the project so that data can be stored securely.
- #### Epic 7: Static and Media Files Configuration:
  As a developer, I want to configure static and media file settings so that product images and other media can be uploaded and displayed.

Each task in this board represents a key step in preparing the environment, ensuring the project is ready for feature implementation and deployment.

#### Feature Implementation Board

The second board focuses on the core features and functionalities required for **Arduino Lab**. This board represents the essential components that enhance the user experience and meet the requirements of a functional e-commerce platform for microcontrollers. It encompasses various user stories, from basic shopping cart functionality to product reviews, enabling a streamlined development process. 

**Task Statuses:**
  
- **Completed**:
  -  #### Epic 1:Product Search and Browsing:
    As a user, I want to browse and search for products like microcontrollers (ESP, AVR, STM32, Raspberry Pi) so I can find what I need easily.
  -  #### Epic 2:Detailed Product Information:
    As a user, I want to see detailed product information for each electronic component so that I can make informed purchasing decisions.
  -  #### Epic 3:Shopping Cart:
    As a user, I want to add multiple products to my shopping cart so that I can purchase them in a single transaction.
  -  #### Epic 4:Account Creation:
    As a user, I want to be able to create an account so that I can save my shipping details and access my order history.
  -  #### Epic 5:Secure Payment:
    As a user, I want to securely pay for my order using common payment methods like credit card or PayPal.
  -  #### Epic 6:Order Confirmation:
    As a user, I want to receive a confirmation of my order after purchase so I can be sure the transaction was successful.
  -  #### Epic 7:Product Filtering:
    As a user, I want to filter products by category (e.g., microcontrollers, sensors, hobby kits) so that I can narrow down my search results.
  -  #### Epic 8:Product Reviews:
    As a user, I want to be able to leave a review on the products Iâ€™ve purchased to share my feedback with other users.
  -  #### Epic 9:Create a Comprehensive README File:
    As a developer, I want to create a detailed README file so that other developers can understand how to set up and contribute to the project.
  -  #### Epic 10:Deployment to Heroku:
    As a developer, I want to deploy the Django project to Heroku so that the e-commerce site is accessible online.

This board represents a progressive approach to adding value to the project by implementing features that improve usability and support a comprehensive shopping experience for users. Using labels like **Must Be**, **Should Be**, and **Could Be** in the Agile workflow allowed me to maintain focus on core project requirements while also planning for additional functionalities that improve the user experience. By organizing tasks in this way, I ensured that critical setup and feature tasks were completed systematically and prioritized appropriately, supporting a clear and effective development path for **Arduino Lab**.

This Agile workflow allowed me to manage tasks efficiently, keeping track of progress and completing each step in an organized manner. Each user story reflects a specific component or functionality critical to the overall success of the **Arduino Lab** project. By dividing the work into these two boards, I maintained clarity between the setup tasks and feature development, ensuring that the project goals were achieved systematically.
